<p>Mantis ships never surrender or run, except in the <a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Mantis_Ship-Collectors">Ship Collectors</a> event. In most events, exactly one of their crew is an Engi. Those statements do not apply to pirates.</p>

<p>All Mantis ships have Mantis Pheromones, including pirates.</p>
